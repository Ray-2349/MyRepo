        <p>"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself." - Sheev Palpatine or Darth Sidious.</p>

            <h2>Reflection Essay</h2>
            <p>Some challenging things a new learner can face is learning how to properly upload things into your GitHub 
            and how to get code from XML to youe site in one piece. One challenge is getting everything translated from 
            the XML file to the site. Knowing how to code is important skill to know when making either of these sites.
            I want to improve my skills with css. Some advantages here are the being able to use your GitHub pretty easily on here.
