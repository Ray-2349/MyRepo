        <h1>No Hacker's Sky Review</h1>
        <figure>
     <p>The game I chose was No Hacker's Sky, it is a text based game where you navigate through code like a hacker would. 
         It's namesake is No Man's Sky an open world space name where you explore the universe it's like that in the regard of being
         able to explore the different codes and nodes as you progress in the game.

          <p>It starts off with asking for your name and gives a tip on how to begin your session. 
          You'll spend some time discovering how to navigate properly through the game, with the
          help command being the used most command in your playthrough. As you play through it the game 
          will unlock more ways to interact with the it's world and how to navigate it.</p>

            <p>
           While the help command does help you alot during gameplay some of the commands you have to figure out
           how to use it on your own. Trial and error is a major stepping stone in thr game creating a sense of challange
           and intrigue to continue playing and discovering more.

        <p>This shows how almost all the commands are connected in someway. With the help command being linked to all
        commands either indirectly or directly.</p>
